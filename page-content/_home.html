<h6 class="mdc-typography--subtitle1">Computer Science Educator and Advocate</h6>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">Following a career in the tech sector, I became an educator and have had the privilege of helping others learn in a variety of contexts:  university courses, high school courses, summer camps for kids, training for high school teachers, and more.</p>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">Now, my primary focus is teaching at the <a href="http://uic.edu">University of Illinois - Chicago</a>, but I also continue to do some work with Chicago Public Schools, with Code.org and with non-school programs for young people in Chicago.</p>
